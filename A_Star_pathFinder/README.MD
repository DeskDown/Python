## A* search algorithm

A* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.)

This program is written in Python 3.8 ans it uses Pygame module for graphics.
